I have recently started to appreciate science, especially these almost finished years as an undergraduate student.  </p>\n<p>When I first started to think about -WeStillAlive- I was reentering my country of origin, Italy, from Nairobi, Kenya.</p>\n<p>After about two months spent in Nairobi working in a private clinic in central Kawangware, one of Africas biggest slums in Kenya, I let grow the idea in my head that my life could never be the same as before after that time spent in Africa. To fund-raise and devote every single effort applied in this blog to people I saw with my own eyes is what I wanted to do mostly.</p>\n<p>So, I started -WeStillAlive- to share personal experiences, such as the one in Nairobi, and facts, such as interesting topics in scholastic subjects, that have companied me throughout my studies at TJU, maintaining a global mindset with an emphasis in science and medicine.</p>\n<p>In summary, with -WeStillAlive-, I want to share the content of actuality and familiarity giving a scientific point of view to well-understood subjects let sometimes lay into superficiality. My goal is to create a pleasant atmosphere in which one person's interest and curiosity can come meet science and its educative objective. With that, I want to engage people and science from a more global perspective, a place to place from Nairobi to Italy back to Philadelphia where I study.</p>\n<p>I truly believe science and medicine will be at the need for a broader approach, a global approach that lastly can come together for the benefit of one public healthcare unit.</p>\n<h3>Michele Ganz - Author</h3>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mia San","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/13289511c9fcba44afec2e28c9ac89a0/5dbbf/about.jpg","srcSet":"/static/13289511c9fcba44afec2e28c9ac89a0/89b9c/about.jpg 512w,\n/static/13289511c9fcba44afec2e28c9ac89a0/26852/about.jpg 1024w,\n/static/13289511c9fcba44afec2e28c9ac89a0/5dbbf/about.jpg 2048w,\n/static/13289511c9fcba44afec2e28c9ac89a0/613b6/about.jpg 3072w,\n/static/13289511c9fcba44afec2e28c9ac89a0/5f7bf/about.jpg 4032w","sizes":"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"00dd1ed5-a142-5261-8c8f-4b5a1bb9adce"}}}
